## SalesReinforcer
#### Background:
A technology company in the Education industry offers various services to customers ranging from startups, SMEs and enterprises to help them upskill. The company wants to develop a platform that the customers can use to benefit from the opportunities and services offered by the company. In line with this goal, the sales team is looking for ways to first understand the underlying patterns in their CRM data, second optimize the user acquisition pipeline to improve their company’s sales funnel with the ultimate goal to create the best user experience.

#### Data Description

The dataset from the company is anonymized to exclude identifying customer information, such as names, emails, etc. Each row in the dataset represents a potential customer. Attributes starting from “Id” to “Interested In” consist of each person’s demographic information, such as where they live, or what training they have. Starting with “Message State” to “Subscribed” indicates the steps or attributes for the user acquisition pipeline and illustrates the different steps of customers lifecycle, starting with the initial contact to a prospect to qualified leads, to finally subscribing and becoming a customer.

#### Goals:

The main goal of this project is to design and develop a Reinforcement Learning agent to optimize the user acquisition pipeline that would help us discover the optimal attributes/steps/actions to increase overall sales.
